    <h1>3) Breaking Bad</h1>
    <p>
      Breaking Bad is an American neo-western crime drama television series
      created and produced by Vince Gilligan. The show originally aired on AMC
      for five seasons, from January 20, 2008 to September 29, 2013. Set and
      filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series tells the story of Walter
      White (Bryan Cranston), a struggling and depressed high school chemistry
      teacher who is diagnosed with lung cancer. Together with his former
      student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), White turns to a life of crime by
      producing and selling crystallized methamphetamine to secure his family's
      financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the
      criminal world. The title comes from the Southern colloquialism "breaking
      bad", meaning to "raise hell" or turn to a life of crime.[5]
