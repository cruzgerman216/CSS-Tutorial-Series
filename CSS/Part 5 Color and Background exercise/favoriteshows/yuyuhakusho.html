    <h1>2) Yu Yu Hakusho</h1>
    <p>
      Yu Yu Hakusho follows Yusuke Urameshi, a 14-year-old street-brawling
      delinquent who, in an uncharacteristic act of altruism, is hit by a car
      and killed in an attempt to save a young boy by pushing him out of the
      way.[3][4][5] His ghost is greeted by Botan, a woman who introduces
      herself as the pilot of the River Styx, who ferries souls to the
      "Underworld" or Spirit World (霊界 Reikai) where they may be judged for
      the afterlife. Botan informs Yusuke that his act had caught even the
      Underworld by surprise and that there was not yet a place made for him in
      either heaven or hell. Thus Koenma, son of the Underworld's ruler King
      Enma, offers Yusuke a chance to return to his body through a series of
      tests.[3][4][5] Yusuke succeeds with the help of his friends Keiko
      Yukimura and Kazuma Kuwabara. After returning to life, Koenma grants
      Yusuke the title of "Underworld Detective" (霊界探偵 Reikai Tantei, lit.
      "Spirit World Detective"), charging him with investigating supernatural
      activity within the Human World (人間界 Ningen Kai). Soon Yusuke is off on
      his first case, retrieving three treasures stolen from the Underworld by a
      gang of demons: Hiei, Kurama and Goki.[4]
