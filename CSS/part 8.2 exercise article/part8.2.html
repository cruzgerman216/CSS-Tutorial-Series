        Whether you‚Äôre a new developer or you‚Äôre fairly experienced as a
        programmer, you‚Äôll come to realize that the amount of time you‚Äôve worked
        at a job isn‚Äôt the best way to determine your skill and knowledge as a
        programmer (I know, tell that to the recruiters ü§´).
      </p>
      <p>
        What you do in your spare time and how you choose to take learning into
        your own hands is what‚Äôs going to ultimately determine your success in
        this industry. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important for us as developers to
        adopt a growth mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some excellent ways to learn and improve as a developer. Some
        of those ways are pair-programming, online courses, meetups, work
        experience, building projects and finding a mentor.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my personal favorite ways to learn is to crack open a
        well-written book and try to absorb something from those who have
        distilled years of knowledge and insight into a permanent artifact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are my personal recommendations that I think all developers
        (especially junior ones) should read at some point. These books are all
        highly regarded by professionals in our industry and have the potential
        to leave a profound impact on the quality of your work and your speed of
        development & learning.
