      <p>
        Whether you‚Äôre a new developer or you‚Äôre fairly experienced as a
        programmer, you‚Äôll come to realize that the amount of time you‚Äôve worked
        at a job isn‚Äôt the best way to determine your skill and knowledge as a
        programmer (I know, tell that to the recruiters ü§´).
      </p>
      <p>
        What you do in your spare time and how you choose to take learning into
        your own hands is what‚Äôs going to ultimately determine your success in
        this industry. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important for us as developers to
        adopt a growth mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some excellent ways to learn and improve as a developer. Some
        of those ways are pair-programming, online courses, meetups, work
        experience, building projects and finding a mentor.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my personal favorite ways to learn is to crack open a
        well-written book and try to absorb something from those who have
        distilled years of knowledge and insight into a permanent artifact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are my personal recommendations that I think all developers
        (especially junior ones) should read at some point. These books are all
        highly regarded by professionals in our industry and have the potential
        to leave a profound impact on the quality of your work and your speed of
        development & learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of them stray from the technical details and focus more on giving
        you practical rules about what it means to be a good developer on the
        interpersonal and professional level.

      <h2>1. CLean Code</h2>
      <p class="author">by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)</p>
      <p>
        After you overcome the basic challenges of development and get
        comfortable figuring out how to write code to solve problems, it‚Äôd be a
        good idea to take a look at this book. It turns out that making the code
        work the first time is actually the easy part. The hard part is making
        your code read well so that others are able to understand it and change
        it in the future.
      </p>
      <p>Remember the last time you had to read code like this?</p>
      <p>
        Who knows what it really does. Code like this might work, but the moment
        we need to change it, we have to hope the author of the code is still in
        the company and pray that they are somehow able to decipher what they
        wrote potentially years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        When careful attention isn‚Äôt taken to write code that‚Äôs readable and
        maintainable, we end up with pockets of code like this that everyone is
        afraid to touch, and if it ever breaks, we‚Äôre in trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uncle Bob‚Äôs ‚ÄúClean Code‚Äù teaches you how to identify what clean code
        looks like compared to bad code, and it teaches you how to transform it
        into good code. A task like this sounds trivial to most, but you‚Äôd be
        surprised at how turning a just a few clean software design principles
        into habits can help you write much more professional and scalable code.
      </p>
      <p>
        We‚Äôre software craftspeople, you know. Building a house is not much
        different than building an application in principle. We need to pay
        attention to the details or else it can all become very expensive to fix
        in the future if not done right first time.
