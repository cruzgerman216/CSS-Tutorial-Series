    <h1>3) Yu Yu hakusho</h1>
    <p>
      Yu Yu Hakusho follows Yusuke Urameshi, a 14-year-old street-brawling
      delinquent who, in an uncharacteristic act of altruism, is hit by a car
      and killed in an attempt to save a young boy by pushing him out of the
      way. ... Yusuke succeeds with the help of his friends Keiko Yukimura and
      Kazuma Kuwabara.
