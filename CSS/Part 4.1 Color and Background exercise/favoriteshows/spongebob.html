    <h1>1) Spongebob</h1>
    <p>
      Spongebob Squarepants is an anthropomorphic sponge who lives in a
      pineapple under the sea in the idyllic town of Bikini Bottom. He lives
      next door to Patrick, a starfish who is sweet but dumb as the rock he
      lives under and Squidward, a misanthropic octopus who is consistently
      annoyed by Spongebob and Patrickâ€™s antics. Spongebob and Squidward work at
      the Krusty Krab, a fast food joint that is owned by Mr. Krabs, who is
      avaricious enough to make Scrooge McDuck appear charitable.
